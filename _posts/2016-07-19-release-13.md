title: Release 13
---

We just pushed Release 13 live. These are just about all tech improvements. The Bootstrap alerts mean you should be seeing some more informative colors on the website, though.

* Fixed broken emails
* Minor gem upgrades
* Build process improvements: Check PR author is in CONTRIBUTORS.md under Travis, Check for "forgot to commit Gemfile.lock" in CI, Block external URLs in feature tests
* Add support for Bootstrap alert types
* README file update for Freenode IRC
