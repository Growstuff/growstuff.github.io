Here's the big news:

**You can now sign up and log in using Facebook!**

The maps are also working again (yay!), we have links to OpenFarm for better open data integration, and we fixed where the harvest thumbnails link.

**Plus**: developer Brenda has started work on an app, and for that made improvements to the sign-in/sign-out API.

Give it a try!
